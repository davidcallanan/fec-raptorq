Eventaully I want to create a wrapper around `raw`.

The plan is when encoding i could choose:

{
	"strategy": {
		"F_source_object_size": {
			"acquisition": "provided",
			"acquisition": "dynamic",
			"value": "...",
			"max_representation_bytes": 2 // can go from 1 to 8
		},
		"T_symbol_size": {
			"acquisition": "provided",
			"max_representation_bytes": 2 // can be 1 or 2
		},
		"Z_number_of_source_blocks": {
			"max_representation_bytes": 1 // must be set to 1
		},
		"",
	},
	"values": [
				
	]
	
}

compressed_values = oti if and only if all strategies use "acquisition": "provided".

The decoder must use the same pre-agreed configuration. The compress_values function would compress this configuration into bytes (max 12) that can be transferred manually (however the strategy is still assumed to be pre-agreed).

However, for any option, if acquisition is dynamic, then its value needs not be present in the decoder process, it is figured out automatically.

the decoder process can include compressed values (uint8array) if so desired.
